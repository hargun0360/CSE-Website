            <h1 className="mb-3 mt-5 green-heading">AKGEC Conference</h1>
            <p>It is witnessed that in the past few years global warming issues are trending high. The cost of fossil fuel is increasing enormously and affecting the economic growth of the Nation. The production of Petrol, diesel and petroleum gas for the year 2022 is on hold due to decision taken by the summit.   It is therefore imperative to spread the awareness about environmental and economic issues created by the use of fossil fuel and the importance of stepping towards the green energy technology. The aim of this conference is to provide a forum for engineers, researchers, and specialists from academia, research centers and industry worldwide to discuss and present the latest developments and challenges in Green Energy and computational intelligence for sustainable Technologies. The international conference on Advancements & Key Challenges in Green Energy and Computing (AKGEC-2023) will offer themes in the engineering aspects of renewable energy and computing. The main aim of this conference will be to provide an international premier forum for the presentation of new advances and research results in the field of Green Energy, Computing and security, sustainable development, Artificial intelligence and Embedded Systems. </p>

      <p>The city of Ghaziabad was founded in 1740 A.D. by Ghazi-ud-Din, who served as a wazir in the court of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah, and named it as "Ghaziuddinnagar" after his own name. The name "Ghaziuddinnagar" was shortened to its present form, i.e. "Ghaziabad" with the opening of the Railways in 1864. During the Mughal period, Ghaziabad and especially the banks of the Hindon in Ghaziabad, remained a picnic spot for the Mughal royal family.

Establishment of the Scientific Society here, during the same period is considered as a milestone of the educational movement launched by Syed Ahmad Khan. The Scinde, Punjab & Delhi Railway, connecting Delhi and Lahore, up till Ambala through Ghaziabad was opened in the same year. With the completion of the Amritsar-Saharanpur-Ghaziabad line of the Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway in 1870, Delhi was connected to Multan through Ghaziabad, and Ghaziabad became the junction of the East Indian Railway and Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway.

            Uttar Pradesh ('Northern Province') is a state in northern India. With over 200 million inhabitants, it is the most populated state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world. It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh during British rule, and was renamed Uttar Pradesh in 1950, giving it the acronym UP. The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital being Lucknow, and Allahabad serving as the judicial capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was carved from the state's Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and Yamuna, join at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj and flow further east as Ganges. Other prominent rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1% of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82% of total geographical area and net area sown is 68.5% of cultivable area.
<br/><br/>
The state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi to the northwest, Uttarakhand and an international border with Nepal to the north, Bihar to the east, Madhya Pradesh to the south, and touches the states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to the southeast. It covers 240,928 km2 (93,023 sq mi), equal to 7.3% of the total area of India, and is the fourth-largest Indian state by area. Though long known for sugar production, the state's economy is now dominated by the services industry. The service sector comprises travel and tourism, hotel industry, real estate, insurance and financial consultancies. The economy of Uttar Pradesh is the second-largest state economy in India with ₹21.73 lakh crore (US$290 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GSDP of ₹95,000 (US$1,300).President's rule has been imposed in Uttar Pradesh ten times since 1968, for different reasons and for a total of 1,700 days. The state has currently two international airports, Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport (Lucknow) and Lal Bahadur Shastri Airport (Varanasi).
